## Past Projects

My latest [résumé](resume) in [JSON](http://jsonresume.org/) lists past projects, and an [old one](resumexml) in [XML](http://github.com/technicat/resumexml) is still hanging around.

[HomeTeam GameDev](https://hometeamgamedev.com/) interviewed me for their [podcast](https://gamedevslikeyou.libsyn.com/phil-chu), and I presented some [career slides](gamedev-slides) to the [Ren'py](https://www.renpy.org/) class taught by [Pam Lipson](https://www.technologyreview.com/innovator/pamela-lipson/).

I wrote [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](learnunity), published by [Apress](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-4876-7) (obsolete but still in print), and self-published (and un-published) [Technicat on Software](technicat-on-software).

## For Fun

 Made little [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) games under the [Fugu Games](fugugames) label (check out these old [logos](logos)).
 
 Now playing around with tools, like calculating pi in [Processing](processing-pi) and [Scheme](http://github.com/technicat/schemish), writing [Ask an Asian American](aaaa) in [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), [learning](http://github.com/technicat/learngodot) [Godot](http://godotengine.org/), and scripting [tools](http://github.com/technicat/schematic) in [Gauche](https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index.html).

Many of these projects are [open source](http://github.com/technicat/opensource) on [Github](http://github.com/technicat).
