Résumé in [JSON](https://jsonresume.org/), exported to [HTML](http://philipchu.com) using [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) and various [themes](https://jsonresume.org/themes/) (all the ones I could find that didn't generate too many warnings or errors).

Scripts to batch generate the HTML and convert to Markdown are written in [Gauche](https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/).
