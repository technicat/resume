Obtained CS degrees from MIT and Johns Hopkins but started out as a self-taught coder on an Apple II+ in high school. Professionally wandered through the semiconductor, government/defense, internet, and game industries before setting up shop as Technicat LLC, providing contract development and consulting services while self-publishing apps and games. It's all in my https://gamedevslikeyou.libsyn.com/phil-chu[podcast] interview.
